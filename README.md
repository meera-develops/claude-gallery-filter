# React Image Gallery Filter

This is a reusable gallery component that displays items with prices and filters them by a selected price range. The data is local for demonstration purposes, but the component logic is reusable with any data source.

## Claude

This project was built with Claude to learn agentic coding and practice building alongside AI. Claude was used to initialize the project and develop the component. Local assets were provided to Claude along with specific instructions and technical constraints for the component.
